Kickstarter project [100 Dungeons
Deluxe](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/314825490/100-deluxe-dungeons)[^kickstarter]
has finally made its way to my inbox, so I thought I would write up some
notes about it. I wouldn’t consider this a review, but rather a preview
of a book coming available for general sale
soon(ish).[^soon]

## What is a Dungeon?

First, the “dungeons” within the game are varied. You will find an
assortment of locales for your party to explore and pillage gold from.

These are not your traditional dungeons full of 10’ wide corridors
stuffed with rooms of kobolds and orcs. Some samples are “The War
Golem”, “The Clock Tower”, and “The Logic Circuit” being among the most
unique.

Honestly though, it would be difficult to call many of these dungeons in
scope. Many are mere encounters.

## Imagination Required

This is not a supplement for those looking for 100 ready made adventures
like the 4e [Dungeon Delve](http://www.dndclassics.com/product/110211/Dungeon-Delve-4e) book.
These dungeons are succinct. Each dungeon occupies a single page:

* A 1/3 page illustration of the dungeon,
* A paragraph or two about the dungeon and sometimes an abbreviated history,
* A bullet list of items that are found there, including occupants andtreasure
* A hand drawn map of the dungeon, often cut-away style.

And that’s it. Not a lot of detail. This book would a great supplement
to a game such as FATE (probably Accelerated more so than Core) or
Dungeon World where the GM is ready to improvise and extrapolate.

## Should I Buy?

I paid $10 for the PDF, and I don’t regret the purchase. With the
caveats above, this makes a fine edition to any GM’s bag. I do look
forward to running one or two of these as mini campaigns in between our
main game.

[^kickstarter]: This PDF is written by Andri Erlingsson, with illustrations by
Justin Gardener and maps by Gill Pearce. The Kickstarter and layout
was done by Chris Lee of Lee’s Lists. This is a preview edition that
is, by their own admission, close to the final product. 

^[soon]: When the book will be available is unknown to me, but will be available on [RPG Now](http://rpgnow.com)
