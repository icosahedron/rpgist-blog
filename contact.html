<p>I don't have comments on this site despite great tools like Disqus and Livefyre.  Matt Gemmell gives <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2011/11/29/comments-off/">some great reasons</a> to not have comments, but I also found them harder to administrate than they're worth.  Instead, I would love to hear your comments via e-mail or Twitter.</p>
