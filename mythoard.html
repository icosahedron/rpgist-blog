              <h1 id="mythoardsmonthlymenagerie">Mythoard’s Monthly Menagerie</h1>

<p>On Saturday a strange little package arrived in the mail. I got my first
Mythoard installment.</p>

<p>The Mythoard package is delivered monthly and contains miscellaneous RPG
related contents. It’s like a Jam-of-the-Month club for gamers.</p>

<h2 id="what’sinthebox">What’s in the Box?</h2>

<p>The first month’s contents are as follows:</p>

<p><a href="http://gothridgemanor.blogspot.kr/2014/11/a-quick-glance-at-mythoard-exclusive.html">Stone Fields of
Azoroth</a>
by Gothridge Manor Games - A small module divided into 3 parts, the
village and two dungeon locations. It’s a short little adventure with
the bonus of a backdrop village if you need one on the fly. It’s system
agnostic; NPCs are given basic class/level and monsters are a sort of
OSR stat block from what I can tell.</p>

<p>The packaging is zine format and nothing special, but the artwork is
nice and a quick read of the adventure gives me some basic ideas for
where to insert these in a one-off night of gaming.</p>

<p><a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/128369/10-Treasures-Magic-Items-for-Dungeon-World">10+
Treasures</a>
by Awful Good Games - this would have been the highlight of the package
if not for the item that follows. It’s a compilation of 31 magic items
for Dungeon World. Also, it gives a good treatise on how to make your
own magic items for DW.</p>

<p>Very impressive little booklet, with great artwork and superior
production values for being so inexpensive.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.redkobold.com/blue-dungeon-tiles/">Blue Dungeon Tiles</a> - I
missed out on the Kickstarter, and having a sampling of these within the
package was a treat. My favorite product in this month’s package and I
look forward to purchasing some of these after the holidays.</p>

<p>These are map tiles that you can draw on. They are a thick laminate with
a shape on one side (e.g. corridor) and a 4x4 grid on the other side.
Kind of like a highly portable, very small Tact-Tiles.</p>

<p>There was also a poster for Baby Bestiary. The poster is interesting,
and the artwork is nice, but mine was bent in shipping.</p>

<p>Last but not least was a postcard of <em>The Mushroom King</em>. (Somehow very
unnerving given the message on the back. Great for a Dungeon Crawl
Classics game probably.)</p>

<h2 id="worth20">Worth $20?</h2>

<p>Hard to say really. The Stone Fields of Azoroth is good quality and an
exclusive, so that’s worth something.</p>

<p>There are only 3 Blue Dungeon Tiles, so not useful as is, but great as a
preview.</p>

<p>The 10+ Treasures goes for $5 in printed format on RPG Now, + whatever
shipping would cost you.</p>

<p>The other items are nice and eclectic, but not exactly what I pine for,
so probably wouldn’t have purchased them separately.</p>

<p>Special note on the packaging. The envelope was a thick cardboard with
that paper-pulse/lint filling that gets everywhere. I hate it. But,
their newsletter states they are working on getting proper boxes, so
this should be a short lived complaint.</p>

<p>I’d say its value is negotiable. 2 definitely will use, one preview for
something I’m likely to purchase, and other minor collectibles I would
pass on.</p>

<h2 id="whataboutnextmonth">What About Next Month?</h2>

<p>I will try it again to see what the contents are. It definitely is fun
to get a package in the mail every month stuffed with items for your
gaming habit.</p>
