<p>D&amp;D 5e is out in force now. You most likely have your PHB, MM, and DMG
in hand, or at least hoping Santa brings them to you.</p>

<p>I don’t think there is another mechanic in the new edition that has
sparked as much interest or devoted so many words as
Advantage<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" class="footnote" title="see footnote">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>Advantage’s appeal is that it’s so simple.</p>

<h2 id="tooadvantageous">Too Advantageous?</h2>

<p>However, Advantage’s (lack of) granularity might make a DM hesitant to
grant it. The math behind Advantage is not linear, but it does on
average grant a +4 bonus. Likewise, Disadvantage penalizes rolls by
–4<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" class="footnote" title="see footnote">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>±4 seems too variable too me. Page 42 of the 4e DMG gives a reasonable
compromise, a static bonus of ±2. But rolling the dice is so much more
fun!</p>

<p>My compromise are what I’m calling Edges and Drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
<li>The player rolls 2 d20: a normal die and an Edge or Drawback die.</li>
<li>If the Edge (or Drawback) die result is odd, then the roll is
discarded and the original die roll is
used<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" class="footnote" title="see footnote">[3]</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pretty simple. The math seems to bear out well
too<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" class="footnote" title="see footnote">[4]</a>:</p>

<p><img src="images/edge_and_drawback.png" title="Edge and Drawback Percentages" alt="Edge and Drawback Percentages" id="edge_math" /></p>

<p>Edge and Drawback Percentages</p>

<p>It seems to give you the ±2 bonus in the middle of the d20 targets. For
example, it’s a 50% chance to roll an 11 or higher on a d20. With
advantage that goes to 75%. And with an Edge, the probability is exactly
in between, at 62.5%; just a little more than the +2 bonus that would
increase the probability to 60% (requiring a 9 or higher). On the
contrary, an Edge gives no difference to Advantage when 20 or 1 is the
target.</p>

<h2 id="bookkeepingandcancellations">Bookkeeping And Cancellations</h2>

<p>Whereas with Advantage, it doesn’t matter which die you roll, an Edge
does require you to specify which one is the Edge Die so that you know
which one to discard if it is odd. Simple enough, just declare which one
it is, much like declaring which d10 is the tens in a percentile roll.</p>

<p>Also, Advantage and Disadvantage cancel each other out regardless of
quantities. If I have Advantage from 2 situations and Disadvantage from
another situation, the rules state that no bonus is given. An Edge could
be used in such a circumstance to still offer some bonus. However, I
like the simplicity of the cancellation rule. I’m recommending that an
Edge only be used when it is the only bonus. Likewise, Drawbacks should
be used only when it is the only negative. Edges or Drawbacks shouldn’t
cancel Disadvantage or Advantage respectively.</p>

<h2 id="andiwouldusethishow">And I Would Use This How?</h2>

<p>So where might you use an Edge? In combat I’m sure there are plenty of
situations that could arise where Advantage would seem too, well,
advantageous. Perhaps kicking dirt in someone’s face as a free action
the first time in combat could give an Edge to the next attack? How
about a skill checking when working together where the second person has
a high ability score but maybe not proficiency in the skill?</p>

<p>In short, I plan on using it where I want to award a bonus for something
clever but not outstanding.</p>

<p>As with all rules, this is just another tool in your GM war chest that
you might be able to use from time to time.</p>

Disadvantage mechanic.

<pre><code>The Online DM gives a good
[introduction](http://onlinedungeonmaster.com/2012/05/24/advantage-and-disadvantage-in-dd-next-the-math/)

<pre><code>Technically it’s only discarded if the Advantage Die is higher and
even, since a lower roll wouldn’t be used anyways.
