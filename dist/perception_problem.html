                    Published January 2014
                </p>
            </div>
<p class="pb-6">Over the holidays a brief discussion took place on Twitter about the
utility of the various perception skills and how they should be divided.
In particular, <a href="http://twitter.com/squach">@Squach</a> of the Tome Show
podcast reasoned/ranted only the necessity for a Perception skill and
that separate Search/Spot skills are redundant. (For this article I will
refer all of these skills, whether a single Perception, specialized
Search vs. Spot, and even Intuition, as general perception skills.)</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl pb-6">Skill System Problems</h2>

<p class="pb-6">The first problem with general perception skills is that they are <em>too</em>
general. Their utility begins to be a crutch, so much so that articles
are written about how to avoid stalling an adventure over a failed
perception skill check.</p>

<p class="pb-6">Besides the debate about perception skills, D&amp;D has also suffered from
unused or underused skills. Usually these skills are knowledge or trade
skills; they often just take up space on the character sheet and are
sometimes tossed token skill points for &#8220;character development.&#8221;</p>

<p class="pb-6">So we have two problems with D&amp;D skills:</p>

<ol class="list-outside list-decimal pb-6 pl-10">
<li>Perception skill overload.</li>
<li>Unused (wasted?) skills in the skill list</li>
</ol>

<p class="pb-6">Is it possible to solve them both? I believe yes.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl pb-6">Perception Generally Considered Harmful</h2>

<p class="pb-6">There should be no general perception skills. To notice or find
something, you have to know what you&#8217;re looking for. This has two
effects:</p>

<ol class="list-outside list-decimal pb-6 pl-10">
<li>other skills become more valuable</li>
<li>attributes are more important</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl pb-6">All Skills are More Valuable</h3>

<p class="pb-6">How does this work? Let&#8217;s look at some examples:</p>

<p class="pb-6">You&#8217;re in a room after having stopped the horrific rite of summoning
from the netherworld. The riddle on the old parchment the wizard gave
you says there is a key in the room that will lock the gate to the Abyss
forever. But where is the key? There is no Search skill or Perception
skill, so how do you find it?</p>

<p class="pb-6">Well, the cleric probably knows something about the religion of this
cult. Might his religious background give him an insight into where such
an item might be hidden? Roll a Religion skill check.</p>

<p class="pb-6">Or the party&#8217;s wizard, with his knowledge of magic, might know that the
key must be kept within certain materials (e.g. lead box) if within a
certain proximity of the gate. Roll an Arcana skill check.</p>

<p class="pb-6">How about the venerable secret door? You&#8217;re in a dungeon that you&#8217;ve
fully explored, but still haven&#8217;t found the artifact you were sent here
to find. It&#8217;s possible it&#8217;s not really here, but your divinations
indicate that it still is. It must therefore be somewhere you haven&#8217;t
been yet, somewhere hidden, behind a secret door. How do you find it?</p>

<p class="pb-6">Well, the dwarven fighter is an expert in dungeoneering. He would likely
know how to spot the telltale signs of a doorway. He would know what
kind of signs of workmanship would indicate a hidden passage and where
it would be dangerous to place such a passage. Roll a Dungeoneering
skill check.</p>

<p class="pb-6">How about something more spontaneous? Your party enters a small book
store looking for a book on town history. Easy, peasy, just roll History
Knowledge (instead of Search).</p>

<p class="pb-6">Knowledge skills become more valuable because they become more
applicable. No more wondering what the engineering or dungeoneering
skill is useful for. No more trying to stretch the circumstances where
players can use these skills.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl pb-6">More than Just Knowledge</h3>

<p class="pb-6">So we see how easy it is to adapt knowledge skills, but what about the
other physical skills like Athletics (Climbing, Swimming, Jumping, et.
al.) or Thievery? These skills are based on Strength or Dexterity. Can
they be used for general perception?</p>

<p class="pb-6">As the party is drudging through the mountains, an orc tribe is
preparing an ambush. Does the party see the orcs hiding in the pass?
Without general perception, how do we know? Based on our previous
examples, we should use a skill that encompasses hiding&#8230; How about
Hide or Thievery? If you know about hiding, it stands to reason that you
could more easily spot someone who is hiding since you know what to look
for.</p>

<p class="pb-6">But it doesn&#8217;t take nimble fingers or a quick step (Dexterity) to spot
someone hiding, you say? True, so just use your Wisdom or Intelligence
attribute + the skill bonus as the skill roll modifier.</p>

<p class="pb-6">Does that mean only the thief can see the hidden orcs? Of course not,
everyone can roll to see; she just simply knows more and therefore is
more likely to see them. You might even have the fighter roll a
Knowledge (Tactics) or something similar if you want to.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl pb-6">Gut Checks</h3>

<p class="pb-6">This guideline is not only for knowledge and practical skills, but the
instinctive situations. Intuition could be considered a general
perception skill.</p>

<p class="pb-6">If we remove Intuition, how do we gut check? Again, depends on the
situation. Want to know if someone is lying? It depends on how they are
lying to you. If they are trying to beat you into submission, roll an
Intimidate skill. Are they trying to smooth talk you? Since you know how
to bluff, you might recognize it.</p>

<p class="pb-6">Gut check skills (can) use Charisma. Given that Charisma is a more
interactive or social attribute, this should work better than the more
concrete skills of Wisdom or Intelligence. Since part of Charisma is
knowing how to talk and act in given situations, detecting such
chicanery should be easier with a higher Charisma.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl pb-6">Attribute Importance</h3>

<p class="pb-6">Removing general perception skills has the side effect of making the
Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma attributes more useful. This is
desirable because:</p>

<ol class="list-outside list-decimal pb-6 pl-10">
<li>that actually matches one of the goals for D&amp;D Next, to be more
attribute driven over skills and feats,</li>
<li>it makes the attribute increases more appealing, increasing the
likelihood that players will select them rather than feats (since anything 
that tempers the potential for overpowered feats is a
good thing in my opinion).
</ol>

<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl pb-6">An Exercise for the DM</h2>

<p class="pb-6">This idea is not a panacea. It would add more tracking work for the GM.
Rather than having the character&#8217;s Perception/Spot checks listed at his
whim, he would likely need their entire skill set available for
consultation when the characters can&#8217;t roll their own skill checks.</p>

<p class="pb-6">Or, this could be an opportunity for more player involvement. Rather
than rolling a silent check behind the screen, the GM could solicit
ideas from the players about how their skills might apply. A well
role-played explanation might even yield a bonus.</p>

<p class="pb-6">I encourage discussion and hope to hear your opinion via e-mail or on
Twitter (@icosahedron). Thanks for reading.</p>
