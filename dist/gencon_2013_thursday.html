<p class="pb-6">That alarm. Oh how I hate it and love it. So tired, but it beckons
towards the Gate of Gaming Goodnessâ„¢. A quick breakfast courtesy of the
hotel and we were on our way to the convention center.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl pb-6">D&amp;D Next All Access</h2>

<p class="pb-6">The first event on our schedule was the D&amp;D Next All Access. On time, we
quickly formed a group of 6 in the corner table and started our
character creation. I, being fairly flexible on which class to take,
ended up with a human rogue named Egregious^[egregious]. This name
turned out to be prophetic.</p>

<p class="pb-6">We had a group of 7, including myself. Our group members were:</p>

<figure class="pb-6">
<img src="images/ddnaagroup.jpg" alt="ddnaagroup" title="And yes, that is the swag room behind us" />
<figcaption class="text-sm">DYD Next All Access Group</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="pb-6">Group members, starting with me (orange shirt) and going counter
clockwise around the table:</p>

<ul class="list-outside list-disc pb-6 pl-10">
<li>Me - Human Rogue</li>
<li>Tanis Kint - Human Mage</li>
<li>Jeff Soper - Gnome Barbarian</li>
<li>Ivan Soper - Human Cleric</li>
<li>Matt Mosher - Half-Orc Fighter</li>
<li>Matt Barton - Wood Elf Ranger</li>
<li>Tim Stack II - DM</li>
</ul>

<p class="pb-6">This was the highlight of the convention. My feedback was emphatically
that they should do this again. I thought 28 hours with the same people
might be a problem, but we had a good group. And I didn&#8217;t see any other
groups having problems either. D&amp;D players in large part are a good
people, and it showed at this event.</p>

<p class="pb-6">The adventure itself is solid, and the &#8220;pre-production&#8221; notes are
hilarious. I won&#8217;t go into spoilers, but I will say that it seems
deadly. I know of one group who suffered a TPK, and several other
characters died. I came close a couple of times (and actually was dead
until a rule clarification brought be back. Thanks Matt Mosher!).</p>

<p class="pb-6">The adventure is split into 4 parts, centering around Daggerford in the
Forgotten Realms. There are plenty of side quests too, so a group could
stay busy well into 10th level. The XP for the monsters was way off
though, so you will have to level your characters at appropriate
intervals rather than relying on experience points.</p>

<p class="pb-6">I would recommend picking this up. At $30, it&#8217;s a good value, though it
is soft cover, not hard cover like the other &#8220;mega-adventures&#8221;. I know
this adventure was GenCon only, but I&#8217;ve seen quite a few on E-bay
already, so I would go snag one if possible. (Note: I have no copies on
E-bay for sale.)</p>

<p class="pb-6">My only suggestion was to cut the length of the event to, say, 20 hours.
I would have liked to attend more games at the convention. Rather than 2
per day and one on Sunday, having 1 per day and 2 on Sunday would be a
killer way to close out the experience.</p>

<p class="pb-6">Our DM was good and knew the rules and adventure well considering how
massive the adventure is and that he only had the adventure a short
while. Some mistakes were made, but nothing that spoiled the fun. Our
mix was good, and everyone was able to contribute in meaningful ways to
fulfilling the quests. It was hilarious though how my dice really
couldn&#8217;t find a trap or secret door the entire adventure. Luckily they
came through for me in several crucial fights.</p>

<p class="pb-6">There were a few places where we got stuck because we couldn&#8217;t find a
secret door and as mentioned earlier, the module seems particularly
deadly at certain points. The stuck portions could be reworked, and
certain fights should be deadly, so these aren&#8217;t really issues, but
perhaps small caveats for would be GM&#8217;s running this at home.</p>

<p class="pb-6">I am tempted to talk about the rogue in the current playtest, but since
the next (and final public) playtest is only a month away, I won&#8217;t waste
the effort.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl pb-6">Swag</h3>

<p class="pb-6">This event was expensive, $100, but it was worth it in swag alone.</p>

<figure class="pb-6">
<img src="images/ddnaaswag.jpg" alt="ddnaaswag" />
<figcaption class="text-sm">D&D Next All Access Swag</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="pb-6">The box was a nice touch, and to include the seal and candle that were
on the invitation was just icing on the cake. However, the best were the
signatures within our copies of the Ghosts of Dragonspear Castle. The
dev team did a great job in making unique and funny personalized
messages. Not one of the messages in our table&#8217;s copies were the same.</p>

<p class="pb-6">In addition to the gifts, we were allowed entry into the D&amp;D Party
Thursday night and a free copy of Temple of Elemental Evil CRPG from
<a href="http://gog.com" class="text-blue-600 no-underline hover:text-blue-800 hover:text-underline"></a>>GOG</a>. Now if only it included access to the private
alpha test going on until publication of the final game&#8230; :)</p>

<h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl pb-6">Dev Team</h3>

<p class="pb-6">What a great bunch of guys. In general RPG creators are friendly and
love to speak with their fans. The same is no less true for the D&amp;D Next
R&amp;D Team. Mike Mearls and Rodney Thompson in particular came over and
solicited feedback and provided clarifications to our table on multiple
occasions.</p>

<p class="pb-6">(Yes, I&#8217;m a D&amp;D fanboy.)</p>

<h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl pb-6">All Access?</h3>

<p class="pb-6">Frankly, I&#8217;m not sure why it was called All Access. I mean, we got
access to the 28 hour adventure, and to the party, but that was it. It&#8217;s
not like we were entered into a secret design cabal where they explained
the future of D&amp;D to us&#8230; Man, that would have been cool.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl pb-6">Artemis</h2>

<p class="pb-6">Our noon&#8211;4 event was Artemis. Artemis is a starship bridge simulator
meant to be played by multiple people in the same room. Tanis and his
friends played it for his 18th birthday, so when we saw that there were
sessions available at GenCon, we made sure to sign up.</p>

<p class="pb-6">We had a blast. We played 3 games, two half hour scenarios and one hour
long, difficult one. Tanis assumed two roles for each scenario. He was
the captain for all the scenarios and played the helm in the first
scenario and the engineer in the second and third games. The other
player, Boon, was our weapons officer for each game. For the first
scenario I was the engineer and for the remaining scenarios I was the
helmsman. The last role of science officer was filled by one of the
Artemis staff.</p>

<figure class="pb-6">
<img src="images/artemiscrew.jpg" alt="artemiscrew" title="Myself, Tanis and Boon possessed by The Lights of Zetar" />
<figcaption class="text-sm">Artemis Crew</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="pb-6">The game wasn&#8217;t as fluid as I had imagined it, but it was incredibly fun
nonetheless. I preferred helmsman to engineer, but engineer was fun as
well. The best part was that each role contributed to the game.</p>

<p class="pb-6">The staff did a good job of introducing the game, and Tanis was a good
captain, directing us and often explaining the function of our station
patiently.</p>

<p class="pb-6">I would definitely play this again at a future convention. I&#8217;d also like
to set it up for our D&amp;D group to try one night.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl pb-6">Giant Settlers of Catan</h2>

<p class="pb-6">Mayfair set up several tables with giant and mammoth versions of their
Settlers of Catan game. We played on one of the Giant tables.</p>

<figure class="pb-6">
<img src="images/giantsettlerstable.jpg" alt="giantsettlerstable" title="I think I could make one of these" />
<figcaption class="text-sm">Giant Settler's Table</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="pb-6">The other two players were Scott and Ron. The time slot was 2 hours, and
we were able to fit in 2 games. Scott won the first game, and he made a
good charge for the second, but Tanis won that one with a last minute
victory point development card coupled with longest road and largest
army. At least Ron made a good showing in both; I never came close to
competing in either game.</p>

<figure class="pb-6">
<img src="images/giantsettlersplayers.jpg" alt="giantsettlersplayers" title="Tanis, Ron, Scott, myself" />
<figcaption class="text-sm">Giant Settler's Players</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="pb-6">It was amazing how many people came to take photographs of the board.
The most unique event during the game had to be this:</p>

<figure class="pb-6">
<img src="images/giantsettlersdice.jpg" alt="giantsettlersdice" />
<figcaption class="text-sm">Giant Settler's Dice Cocked</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="pb-6">Tanis threw this dice and that&#8217;s how it landed. More remarkable is that
it wasn&#8217;t stuck in a divot. It just landed on its curved corner like
that.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl pb-6">D&amp;D Party</h2>

<p class="pb-6">We hadn&#8217;t originally intended to go to this. Instead we had registered
for NASCRAG, but we were so tired after the day that staying up until
1am would have been herculean. Tanis was so tired he didn&#8217;t even go to
the party with me.</p>

<p class="pb-6">The party was about what you would expect: loud and crowded. I can&#8217;t say
I had particular fun, but I did have the chance to have some book signed
by R.A. Salvatore and Ed Greenwood. I also met Robin Laws and had him
autograph a card, since I wasn&#8217;t sure if I would get the opportunity to
see him later at the show.</p>

<p class="pb-6">During the party they celebrated Drizzt&#8217;s 25th anniversary as a
character in the Forgotten Realms and had Salvatore cut a big cake and
then served it.</p>

<p class="pb-6">There was a fun mystery game where you would help solve a murder by
collecting clues through talking to the right people. I didn&#8217;t
participate and left the party early.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl pb-6">Good night GenCon, Good night Brain of Mush</h2>

<p class="pb-6">After the first full day, I was so tired I wasn&#8217;t sure how the rest of
the con was going to go.</p>
