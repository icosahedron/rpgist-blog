<p class="pb-6">Our weekly RPG gaming night has been sauntering a bit lately. After 3
years of playing 4e through the Scales of War Adventure path, we imbibed
in the D&amp;D Next playtest. That gave us a taste for simpler fare, and we
haven’t looked back.</p>

<p class="pb-6">We’ve sampled<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="text-sm align-top">1</a> Dungeon World, Numenera, more D&amp;D Next, and now
FATE Accelerated (FAE).</p>

<p class="pb-6">I thought it would be helpful to others to write about our experience
with FATE Accelerated and what worked well for us. This isn’t a review
of the system, but rather some tips that either helped me or I wish I
would have known.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl pb-6">What is FATE Accelerated?</h2>

<p class="pb-6">FATE is not a single RPG game, but rather a family of systems that
provides rules for various genres. RPG Geek explains
<a href="http://rpggeek.com/rpgsystem/577/fate-system">FATE</a> well and has a
<a href="http://rpggeek.com/rpgsystem/577/fate-system#linkeditems">list of games or
settings</a>
“powered by FATE”.</p>

<p class="pb-6">Last year, Evil Hat held a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/evilhat/fate-core">Kickstarter
campaign</a> that
funded the release of a setting neutral version of FATE, entitled aptly
<em>FATE Core</em>. After the funding, Evil Hat released the Core Rulebook as a
pay-what-you-like edition.</p>

<p class="pb-6">As part of this Kickstarter campaign, one of the stretch goals was a
slimmed down version of subtitled <em>Accelerated</em>. The book is 48 pages
long in a 6“x9” format and available at your local game shop for $5. It
is also available through the same pay-what-you-like format as FATE
Core.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl pb-6">Settling on Settings</h2>

<p class="pb-6"><strong>Tip 1: Start with what you know.</strong></p>

<p class="pb-6">First, realize that FAE is not a beefy system, nor is it crunchy. It is
perhaps the most rules light RPG I’ve ever played (with the possible
exception of Fiasco, if you choose to call that an RPG). And being so
thin, it doesn’t really give you setting or genre. In other words,
you’re on your own.</p>

<p class="pb-6">Our group is, so far, strictly fantasy. Elves, orcs, and dragons inhabit
our stories and battle mat. While this might have been an opportune time
to introduce a new genre to our group, we decided to keep the variance
low so that we could better judge the system on its own merits.</p>

<p class="pb-6">I’m glad we did, because there are some subtleties to FAE that perhaps
would have been lost if we had ventured too far outside our comfort
zone.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl pb-6">D6 Aplenty</h2>

<p class="pb-6"><strong>Tip 2: Have Plenty of d6</strong></p>

<p class="pb-6">FAE uses d6 dice. You can use the special FATE Dice, but I found that d6
with 1–2 = minus, 3–4 = neutral, and 5–6 = plus is just as effective. I
bought a couple of cubes of the 36 Chessex mini d6 at the local games
store.</p>

<p class="pb-6">Most of our players didn’t have enough d6 in their own, and even when
they did, they liked being able to switch dice around (as all
superstitious gamers do).</p>

<p class="pb-6">I liked having 3 colors, one for the players and two for separate groups
if you have multiple groups of NPCs. Besides, the dice are small enough
that they make great FATE point tokens and counters too.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl pb-6">I am My Brother’s Keeper</h2>

<p class="pb-6"><strong>Tip 3: Use Relationships</strong></p>

<p class="pb-6">In a rules light system with no inherent setting, you need a catalyst
for adventures. Fiasco/DungeonWorld style relations can be those seeds.
(Dungeons of FATE brought this up, and we believe it.)</p>

<p class="pb-6">In our group, half of the players knew each other as former prisoners of
the local baron. This made it easy as an adventure plot: They have to
re-enter the dungeon to rescue a special prisoner.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl pb-6">Using Is Reusing</h2>

<p class="pb-6"><strong>Tip 4: Use what you have</strong></p>

<p class="pb-6">Given FATE’s simplicity, it is very easy to adapt an adventure or
setting. No reason not to use an old adventure from your collection.</p>

<p class="pb-6">I actually used 3, <a href="http://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/60466/honor-among-thieves"><em>Honor Among
Thieves</em></a> and
<a href="http://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/49288/against-the-cult-of-the-reptile-god"><em>Against the Cult of the Reptile
God</em></a>,
along with a sprinkle of <a href="http://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/46874/the-sinister-secret-of-saltmarsh"><em>Secret of
Saltmarsh</em></a>.
I doubt any of my players would recognize them.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl pb-6">An Aspect of FATE</h2>

<p class="pb-6">We’ve just started playing games that have elements or components that
allow player fiat. Even with physical reminders, I still had to remind
the players to take advantage of the aspects in a sceme or to use their
fate points.</p>

<p class="pb-6">For aspects especially, I would write them down on a whiteboard or
battlemat so that everyone can see them. This should hopefully remind
everyone to think of new aspects as the scene changes too.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl pb-6">Affect an Effect</h2>

<p class="pb-6"><strong>Tip 6: Allow FATE points to alter the situation.</strong></p>

<p class="pb-6">In FAE, two guidelines are given for Fate Points:</p>

<ol>
<li>add +2 to a roll or,</li>
<li>re-roll the attempt.</li>
</ol>

<p class="pb-6">However, a Fate Point, could be so much more useful. Need an iron spike?
Or how about a healing potion hidden in the bottom of the chest? Let
your players introduce elements to the story or have resources available
in exchange for a Fate Point.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl pb-6">I Attribute His Success to His Approach</h2>

<p class="pb-6"><strong>Tip 7: Approaches are not Attributes</strong></p>

<p class="pb-6">One of the more unique aspects (pun intended :)) of FAE is that it
doesn’t use attributes in their traditional sense. Rather, it uses
<em>approaches</em>, or the style with which a character uses to solve a
situation.</p>

<p class="pb-6">Approaches are the simple method that FAE uses to decouple skills and
attributes in the same way I mention in the articles <a href="./perception_problem.html">Perception
Problems</a> and <a href="./perception_problem_followup.html">Perception Problem
Follow-up</a>.</p>

<p class="pb-6">Probably the best way to describe is to use a FAE book example, trying
to get into a castle:</p>

<ul>
<li>Careful - watch the guard schedules and recognize the patterns for
the best time to sneak on</li>
<li>Clever - figure out the weak spots in the fortress wall or spot the
secret way in or even how to get the objective to come out to you</li>
<li>Flashy - talk your way in or distract the guards with a diversion</li>
<li>Forceful - beat your way in or figure out how to bring the walls
down</li>
<li>Quick - Take advantage of a distraction to duck inside</li>
<li>Sneaky - Good old fashioned through the window to unlock the doors</li>
</ul>

<p class="py-6">As you have probably surmised, many approaches can be used to accomplish
the same things and there can be significant overlap. Not really a
problem though. The versatility that approaches have allow for some
roleplaying creativity. (However, it is important that the GM not allow
everything. But that’s a topic for another article.)</p>

<p class="pb-6">Like aspects though, a GM for a new group will often have to ask how
they are accomplishing what they are trying to do. Invariably the
players will look at their character sheets to see which approach gives
the biggest bonus at first. This is okay! However, you can gently
suggest that an aspect might go better with a certain approach and
deliver an overall higher bonus.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl pb-6">You Are the Captain of Your FATE</h2>

<p class="pb-6">FATE definitely exercises the “less is more” mantra, getting out of your
way. However, its brevity can also work against new players and GMs.
Hopefully these and other suggestions can help you get your game up and
running.</p>

<p class="pb-6">If nothing else, FATE can give you additional approaches (Ha!) to use in
your games, no matter what system. I plan on continuing using aspects in
my D&amp;D games.</p>

<p class="pb-6">To paraphrase Dante - &quot;FATE cannot be taken from you; it is a gift.&quot;</p>
