<h1 id="probability-for-game-designers">Probability for Game Designers</h1>
<p>Specifically, myself as an aspiring table-top game designer.</p>
<p>In addition to game design, probability is useful lots of other places, but learning it via game design seems like fun, so I thought I would try it.</p>
<h2 id="dd-dice-diagrams">D&amp;D (Dice &amp; Diagrams)</h2>
<p>Almost everything will be presented as examples with dice or other pieces of chance, such as coins or cards.</p>
<p>Not a lot math will be used, though one goal I have is to learn the math well enough to sort through the books and videos on probability, so I will likely show how some facets of probability from our game design perspective is expressed as math.</p>
<h2 id="any-dice">Any Dice</h2>
<p>Any Dice will be used to illustrate some of the concepts. It‚Äôs a great tool, so I aim to use it to express as much as possible. I hope that you will use it too.</p>
<h2 id="percentages">Percentages</h2>
<p>Most people I believe understand percentages, at least figuratively. For my purposes, they will serve as the baseline for comparison.</p>
<p>For example, say I‚Äôm designing a success mechanic for an RPG, one of the first questions I might ask myself is ‚ÄúHow would this work so that a competent character would succeed 75% of the time?‚Äù</p>
<h3 id="example-of-percentage-use">Example of Percentage Use</h3>
<p>GM Tanis is thinking of his game, and wants to make some challenges for his party in an upcoming adventure. He has a rough idea of how difficult he wants these challenges to be, but doesn‚Äôt know how to determine what the difficulty rating should be in his game.</p>
<p>He starts with a knowledge of his PCs and decides to make the challenge hard, so he opts for a 30% success chance. He will use what we learn in this series to determine what the mechanic expression should be.</p>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>Simple code snippets from time to time, though this isn‚Äôt really meant to be the focus of the series. Most likely we will use <code>Python</code>, as that seems to be a language that translates from English well.</p>
<h2 id="distributions">Distributions</h2>
<p>One of the key questions I have, and I think most game designers should have, is how often should something succeed based on the mechanic used or character attribute.</p>
<p>This can be modeled as a ‚Äúdistribution‚Äù, which is largely a way of dividing results up into categories that might be different sizes. Distributions are usually modeled visually with a diagram called a histogram that gives a ‚Äúshape‚Äù.</p>
<h1 id="a-single-fair-die">A Single Fair Die</h1>
<p>To start off, let‚Äôs consider something that most of us intuitively know, a single die roll.</p>
<p>The number of sides is relatively immaterial for this discussion, but let‚Äôs assume a twenty-sided die (d20), a common die used in RPGs.</p>
<p>Rolling this die means that any individual number should come up <em>on average</em> 1 time per 20 rolls. (On average is important and will be explained later.)</p>
<p>Hopefully this just ‚Äúmakes sense‚Äù to you.</p>
<h2 id="percentage-per-face">Percentage per Face</h2>
<p>Again, hopefully this is intuitive, but just to explain it, to know how often a number comes up, we convert its chances to a percentage. When a dice has <span class="math inline">n</span> faces, we say that it has a <em>1 in <span class="math inline">n</span></em> chance of occurring. This is expressed as a fraction, <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{n}</span>. To get the percentage, we compute the decimal representation of this fraction, so <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{20} = .05 = 5\%</span>.</p>
<p>For a six-sided die (d6), each number has a 1 in 6 chance of showing face up on each roll, so the percentage chance for each number is <span id="one_over_six_approx_17_percent">\\frac{1}{6} \\approx 17\\%</span> (the <span id="approx">\\approx</span> means approximately, though I imagine you already know this; <span id="six_times_seventeen_equals_102">6 \\times 17 = 102</span>, just a little more than 100. Converting <span id="one_sixth_equals_0_1overline66">\\frac{1}{6} = 0.1\\overline{66}</span>, but we will convert this to our nearest whole number).</p>
<h3 id="gm-tanis-example">GM Tanis Example</h3>
<p>GM Tanis is playing D&amp;D, and wants to make his players go a certian route, but doesn‚Äôt want to make it seem like he‚Äôs railroading them, so he places a door in their path, but one that‚Äôs exceedingly hard to pass. The only way to get past it in his estimation is to roll a 20. So he looks at the sheets of the PCs and sees that PC Garrett has an Athletics bonus of +7, so that means that the DC to open the door should be 27.</p>
<p>(Whether or not this is the correct way to establish challenges is beyond the scope of this article.)</p>
<h2 id="distribution">Distribution</h2>
<p>The distribution, or shape of a single die is uniform. You can imagine what that means, or you can look at the handy illustration I copied from <a href="https://anydice.com/program/2f">anydice</a>.</p>
<p><img src="images/uniform-distribution.png" alt="uniform-distribution" style="height:50%; width:50%; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;" /></p>
<p>Each number has an even chance of coming up, so the chance is uniformly distributed, making thus the distribution uniform. üë®‚Äçüè´</p>
<h2 id="lets-roll">Let‚Äôs Roll</h2>
<p>Next up for me to learn is 2 dice rolls and how those can be combined. üé≤ üé≤</p>
