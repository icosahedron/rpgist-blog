<p>If you play RPGs, chances are you’ve heard of Monte Cook and his game
Numenera. It’s an ambitious RPG set a billion years into the future of
Earth, where technology is so advanced that it’s indistinguishable from
magic.</p>

<p>The setting is very cool, and lends to all sorts of weird possibilities
for play. Monte writes “discovery is the soul of Numenera.”, and the
setting is geared largely for that. It’s all new and <em>weird</em>. XP is
likewise handed out for discovery rather than conquering.</p>

<p>But there is one aspect of the game that makes it more interesting:
choice.</p>

<p>By their nature, RPGs offer more choice than any other game type. What
other game type allows you to weigh whatever you want to do and then
play out the consequences? None that I’m aware of. Choice is the reason
that an RPG requires a human
referee.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a></p>

<p>That said, Numenera has two mechanics which help players and GMs make
more interesting choices: <em>GM Intrusions</em> and <em>Effort</em>.</p>

<h2 id="gmintrusions">GM Intrusions</h2>

<p>GM Intrusions are used by the GM to award experience for endangering the
characters. The GM will put the character in a situation, usually for
the worse, and the player can either accept the situation and earn XP,
or pay an XP to avoid the situation. If the player doesn’t have XP, then
they cannot refuse the situation.</p>

<p>GM Intrusions give the player a choice to make, accept the failure or
danger for reward later, or safety now at expense of progression. They
also give the GM greater fiat in introducing consequences; it is more
satisfying to inconvenience a character/player when you know they can
refuse it or accept it with a perk.</p>

<p>True to their name, XP are used to advance the character. They may also
be used to re-roll pernicious failures. The player chooses to sacrifice
future progression for benefit (often safety) now.</p>

<p>Numenera is not the sole RPG with this mechanic. The astute reader will
note that Intrusions are very similar to compelling aspects as done in
the FATE RPG. Many other RPGs also now use points or tokens to make
consequences more palatable, which may be redeemed for various benefits,
e.g. re-rolls or bonuses.</p>

<p>One small difference, though kind of fun, is that a GM Intrusion
actually yields 2 XP to the recipient, who is then obliged to give one
of them to another player. This stretches the character’s choices
further; I’ve seen players accept an intrusion just to be able to give
an XP to another player who is having difficulty (especially when
someone is suffering from bad die rolls).</p>

<h2 id="effort">Effort</h2>

<p>Effort is the mechanic that gives players interesting choices, where
they can decide whether or not something is important enough to invest
directly in the outcome. In other words, whether to put some skin in the
game.</p>

<p>When making a roll, a player may use some of their attribute points to
add to the roll. Spending these attribute points is called <em>expending
effort</em>. Spending those attribute points can affect other actions later
in the game (e.g. spending <em>might</em> points makes the character more
susceptible to wounds).</p>

<p>Why is this special? Because, before a roll is made, a character can
decide if an action is really something they wish to accomplish. If so,
they literally put something of themselves into the action. They can
push themselves a little further or harder than normal, at the sacrifice
of their might, speed, or intellect.</p>

<p>There are other mechanics within other RPGs that allow a player to
influence the chances of success for actions they consider important,
such as SOTC’s Bennies, Dr. Who’s Story Points, or even D&amp;D’s
Inspiration. But those mechanics don’t actually demand something of the
character. Effort is a direct sacrifice of the character.</p>

<p>Often during our games, I neglect to announce the difficulty of a task,
but still ask if they wish to expend effort. This is to encourage the
player to ask themselves if the action is important enough to their
character, rather than expending effort simply to boost chances at a
difficult task.</p>

<h2 id="reinforcingchoice">Reinforcing Choice</h2>

<p>The opportunity to sacrifice progression (XP) or well-being (attributes)
to prove that something is important is something I’ve not seen in other
RPGs.</p>

<p>Numenera is a unique RPG, not only for its setting, but for the
mechanics it employs to encourage the characters to invest themselves
into their actions and decide what is important. It encourages the
players to make choices about their characters, and choices make the
game more interesting.</p>

<p>I should clarify I mean player choice, not GM choice. GM’s make
decisions based on mechanics all the time, e.g., using the level of
the players to decide how difficult a foe should be. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
