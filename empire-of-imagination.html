<p>Empire of Imagination</p>

<p>I just finished the <a href="http://empireofimagination.com">biography of Gary Gygax by Michael
Witmer</a>. It’s a very good book.</p>

<p>I don’t know the history of Gary Gygax very well, so I can’t vouch for
its authenticity, but the format of telling chronological vignettes from
Gary’s life works well.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of meeting Gary a couple of times at GenCon. He was
affable and loved to chat about D&amp;D with his fans. This book reflects
the man that I met.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Gary’s life was not always a happy one, and Mr. Whitmer
doesn’t sugar coat it. Nor does he take Gary to task, but sticks to his
story, such as it is. He portrays Gary as human.</p>

<p>I especially appreciated the history of TSR from Gary’s perspective. I
learned more about who Gary was and how he ended up where he did.
Business acumen was not one of his talents.</p>

<p>I did feel that the last couple of chapters describing the influence of
Gary and Dungeons &amp; Dragons were a little overstated. However,
considering the influence that D&amp;D has had on me, perhaps it isn’t
hyperbole. I would be a different person if I hadn’t played D&amp;D.</p>

<p>After reading the book, I think of Gary a bit like J.R.R. Tolkien
(something I’m not sure he would appreciate): a great imagination that
ignited something special, but by no means the best at his craft. Still,
without his first steps, there would not be a path for others to have
followed.</p>

<p>If you have a love for RPGs and would like to know their creator better,
I recommend the book whole-heartedly.</p>
