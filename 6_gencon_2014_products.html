title: 6 Products at GenCon
date: July 30, 2014</p>

<h2 id="author:jaykint">author: Jay Kint</h2>

<h1 id="6productsatgencon">6 Products at GenCon</h1>

<p>I’m fortunate enough to be attending GenCon this year, so I’ve made a
list of products I’m going to check out. This is the list of top
<s>5</s> 6 products that I will be searching for. They are not automatic
purchases, but I’d be hard pressed to imagine why I wouldn’t.</p>

<h2 id="genconfez">GenCon Fez</h2>

<p>So corny, yet so full of gaming goodness. The <a href="http://instagram.com/p/q0D9sqF3pm/">GenCon
fez</a>, or any of the fezzes, really
will accentuate your personality at the gaming table.</p>

<p>Desperately need to roll that 20? Move the tassel to the other side and
blow on the dice 3 times.</p>

<h2 id="13thagebooks">13th Age Books</h2>

<p>Okay, so I’m cheating right off the bat. 13th Age has two new books out,
and I intend to purchase both of them. We play 13th Age right now, and
our GM has both books and likes them.</p>

<p>The <em>13th Age Bestiary</em> looks to correct the most glaring problem with
13th Age - not enough stuff to negotiate with.</p>

<p><em>13 True Ways</em> brings additional classes and options to characters. I
think of this as the 13th Age Unearthed Arcana. I’m sure we’ll pick and
choose through this as we go through our campaign.</p>

<h2 id="riseofthedrow">Rise of the Drow</h2>

<p>The folks at Adventure-A-Week have put together an adventure path with
everyone’s favorite UnderDark villains, the Drow. <a href="http://adventureaweek.com/shop/rise-of-the-drow-trilogy-expanded-revised-hardback/">Rise of the
Drow</a>
looks to be a long adventure on which to base an entire campaign.</p>

<p>It looks to be one of the many campaigns I’m going to run when I’m
retired. :P</p>

<h2 id="dwarvenforgedice">Dwarven Forge Dice</h2>

<p>There is no shortage of really cool dice for gamers, but <a href="http://dwarvenfoundry.com/index.php/7-polyhedral-metal-dice-sets.html">metal dice at
a reasonable
price</a>
are pretty rare. I <em>think</em> these are going to be on sale, so I’m going
to try and snag a set. I’m just not sure which color. I’m currently
enamored with the copper set, but the mithral set looks pretty good too.</p>

<h3 id="gamescience">GameScience</h3>

<p>Once again, I cheat on my list.</p>

<p>GameScience is going to be back! I’m sure to pick up another set of
their dice. Uncle Lou has always had my money.</p>

<h3 id="genconexclusives">GenCon Exclusives</h3>

<p>And yet a third time. Is it funny that I’m cheating on my own list with
dice?</p>

<p>There is always a set of dice that are GenCon exclusives for the year. I
will pick some of these up too, undoubtedly, unless they are hideous.</p>

<h2 id="unframed">Unframed</h2>

<p>Engine Publishing has put out some good books for GMs. I’ve been happy
with their advice for the most part, so I’m looking forward to adding
<a href="http://www.enginepublishing.com/unframed-the-art-of-improvisation-for-game-masters">Unframed</a>
to my library.</p>

<p>I’m sure I’ll review this book shortly after purchasing it.</p>

<h2 id="thestrange">The Strange</h2>

<p>Riding the success of Numenera, Monte Cook Games has followed up with
<a href="http://www.montecookgames.com/product/the-strange-corebook-pre-order/">The
Strange</a>,
a very interesting premise that builds off the weird in Numenera.</p>

<p>I already have the PDF, but constraints have kept me from delving into
it fully. So far though, the production values are phenomenal. I will
pick up the hardcover and hopefully get an autograph or two to accompany
it.</p>

<h2 id="dungeonsdragons5eplayershandbook">Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e Player’s Handbook</h2>

<p>Ah, the raison d’être for GenCon. Celebrating 40 years, Dungeons &amp;
Dragons will again be the centerpiece of the show.</p>

<p>I’m playing in the D&amp;D All Access again, so I hope that the PHB will be
part of the package. If not, I’m sure I’ll succumb and purchase it
anyways.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There are lots of other items that are tempting, but only after
wandering through the Exhibit Hall will I know what I intend to purchase
since I’ll probably have bought it!</p>

<p>I’ll do a post after the show to detail and review the products that I
found most worthy to spend money on. I’m sure the reviews will also show
up in our podcast, the <a href="http://rpgcircus.com">RPG Circus</a>.</p>
