              <h1 id="followuptoiperceiveaproblem">Follow Up to I Perceive a Problem</h1>

<p>As luck would have it, shortly after I published <a href="./perception_problem.html"><em>I Perceive A
Problem</em></a>, game designer Robin Laws wrote an
example that I think exemplifies the idea – far better than I could.</p>

<p>He wrote this with regards to his new system for the
Storyscape<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> game.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, one of the neat things about Storyscape is that the skills and
abilities are decoupled from the attributes.</p>

<p>For example, let’s say your character has the Parachute skill, and:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’ve bailed out of a skycar and you’re plummeting through a
refinery complex… and it’s crucial that you avoid the plasma vents.
You might use Agility + Parachute.</li>
<li>you’re investigating a possible homicide, and you want to know if
the victim’s parachute was packed correctly. You might use
Reasoning + Parachute.</li>
<li>you’re Indiana Jones, and the pilot has just bailed out with the
last parachute, leaving you with nothing but some crates of
chickens, a kid, a showgirl, and an emergency raft. You might use
Creativity + Parachute.</li>
</ul>

<p>This also allows us to have different sorts of people use skills in
different sorts of ways. For example, many games hook Intimidation to
Strength, which makes sense for the sort of gorilla-like thug you see in
old movies. But what about people like Adelai Niska from Firefly? He’s
not particularly strong (as far as we can tell), but he’s all sorts of
intimidating, largely due to his Influence. USMC Drill Instructors might
tie their form of Intimidation to Presence, and the guy who stares at
you while holding his hand over a flame might roll Constitution +
Intimidation. And I don’t even want to think about the potential horrors
suggested by the person who uses Creativity + Intimidation.&quot;</p>

<p>I think that this is a great treatise on what I was referring to, the
idea that your strong attributes can be used in multiple situations
easily and makes skills much more versatile and useful.</p>
