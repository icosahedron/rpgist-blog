              <h1 id="analternativedicesystemforddnext">An Alternative Dice System for D&amp;D Next</h1>

<p><em>This article previously appeared at the Hobbit-Hole.</em></p>

<p>One of the many things I love about <a href="http://dndnext.com">D&amp;D Next</a> are
the Skill Dice and Expertise Dice (I much prefer this name to Martial
Damage Dice). They give the game extra tactical and tactile dimensions.
That actions involve more dice rolling is a great direction for the
game.</p>

<p>The basis for action resolution (DC, AC) is still the venerable d20 +
static bonus. Inveterate tinkerer that I am, I couldn&#8217;t help but imagine
what other dice systems could be used and what their effect might be.</p>

<h2 id="chrissims3d6">Chris Sims&#8217; 3d6</h2>

<p>Chris Sims, one of the 4e designers, posted in a blog entry that his
group uses 3d6 rather than a d20 during combat. (Sadly that blog entry
on Loremaster.org is no longer available due to a crash.)</p>

<p>3d6 generates numbers on a bell curve. All other bonuses being equal,
the net effect is to increase the hit rate from about 60% to 75%. This
makes combat go faster and players got to use their cool powers more
often.</p>

<p>What about the natural 20 critical? Well, Mr. Sims simply calculated
that since natural 20 is a 5% probability, 16+ on 3d6 is also about 5%,
so any roll of 16+ was a critical.</p>

<p>The substitution is easy and straightforward. All other rolls continue
to use d20.</p>

<h2 id="dicepoolfordd">Dice Pool for D&amp;D?</h2>

<p>Our antics with dice don&#8217;t have to end there though. What about the
other checks? Can we make those more exciting than a simple d20 +
modifier?</p>

<p>Since we love to roll dice, let&#8217;s use a dice pool. The more effective
you are with a skill or weapon, the more dice you roll.</p>

<p>An ideal change would have to be roughly the same probability. We don&#8217;t
want to send things too far off the beaten track. If at all possible, we
want to keep all other factors (i.e., DC, AC, HP, etc.) the same, or at
the very least easily adjustable to compensate.</p>

<h3 id="basedice">Base Dice</h3>

<p>Just as with Mr. Sims, we will replace the d20 with 3d6. This gives us a
good approximation of the d20 range but focuses the numbers on 9&#8211;12.
This will make medium DCs easier to achieve, whereas higher DCs will be
more difficult.</p>

<h3 id="bonusdice">Bonus Dice</h3>

<p>Normally a static bonus concocted from ability score, level, skills,
etc. is added to find the total result. Since we are forming a dice
pool, let&#8217;s replace the static bonus with dice!</p>

<p>The list below shows each static bonus and the bonus die roll to
substitute. Each is linked to a chart on
<a href="http://anydice.com" title="Dice Probability Calculator">anydice.com</a> that
shows the probabilities of the dice pool roll to be compared to the
static bonus roll. I&#8217;ve only included through +10; hopefully the
progression should be evident for higher bonuses.</p>

<a href="http://anydice.com/program/1f26/at_least">3d6</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To determine which bonus dice to use, I compared what number would be
rolled at least 50% of the time on a d20 roll and approximated the same
percentage equivalent for the dice pool roll. In most cases, the numbers
that would be rolled 50% of the time were +1 to +2 higher than the
d20+bonus roll (e.g., on a d20+1, 12 or higher will be rolled 50% of the
time; for 3d6+d4, 13.5 or higher will be rolled 50% of the time).</p>

<p>These are fairly straight forward substitutions and maintain roughly
equal probability distributions. If you are truly concerned about
maintaining parity, you could simply add +2 to all DC/AC rolls and be
close enough for government work. I prefer allowing my players to
succeed a little more often. (Remember, monsters will succeed more often
too.)</p>

<p>Since the goal was to keep the probabilities roughly equal, the
progression stutters since it doesn&#8217;t map perfectly. In some cases I
opted to increase the minimum roll rather than the maximum by using a
higher combination of smaller die, such as +3 = d8, +4 = 2d4.</p>

<h3 id="explodingdie">Exploding Die</h3>

<p>In a normal check, a 20 is a thrilling result and usually elicits
cheers. Depending on how many dice you roll in a given session, a 20
probably happens once every session or two. Since we are rolling dice on
a bell curve, the maximum results occur far less often (an 18 on 3d6
occurs ~0.5% of the time). What if we could add something that would
generate the same excitement to our dice pool? Ladies and gentlemen, I
give you the exploding die<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>For those who aren&#8217;t familiar with the term, an exploding die is one
that is rolled again and added to the result, usually when its maximum
value is shown. For example, if an exploding d6 rolls a 6, it is rolled
again and the second roll is added to the original 6. If the second roll
is also a 6, the die is rolled again, ad infinitum.</p>

<p>In our playtest, a single exploding d6 from the base 3d6 seems to work
best. We use a different color die to eliminate confusion about which
die is exploding. The same drama is generated often enough, and we
sometimes see spectacular results. In a tense moment last week, our
wizard was being attacked by a gargoyle and used Shocking Grasp as a
last ditch effort; he rolled a 6, 6, 6, 1 with the exploding die for a
total of 35 on his check. Cheers around the table.</p>

<p>The difference in probabilities is negligible with the exploding die.
Taking the charts above, let&#8217;s examine the +5 roll and see how that
compares:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://anydice.com/program/1c99/at_least">3d6+d10</a> - <a href="http://anydice.com/program/200e/at_least">3d6
exploding + d10</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We can see that the probabilities go up slightly for each number. The
increase for rolling a 10 is 0.4%; rolling an 18 is 4% more likely (less
than a pip on a d20).</p>

<h3 id="criticalsandfumbles">Criticals and Fumbles</h3>

<p>As with the rest of this mechanic, keeping the frequency of criticals
and fumbles is a goal. Since these happen 5% of the time on a d20,
that&#8217;s our metric. Also, since the static bonuses aren&#8217;t taken into a
account, neither is the bonus die; only the base 3d6 are used.</p>

<p>Using 3d6 with an exploding die, a <a href="http://anydice.com/program/200f/at_least">19+ occurs about 5% of the
time</a>. Since we are using an
exploding die though, more dramatic totals are possible. We can use that
to create some more dramatic effects: when the exploding die rolls a 6
more than once, damage is increased an additional multiple. For example,
in the wizard&#8217;s roll above, the two extra rolls of 6 resulted in a 3x
max damage multiplier.</p>

<p>Fumble probabilities are handled similarly. Since 6 or lower happens 5%
of the time, any roll of 6 or lower on the base 3d6 is an automatic
failure. While lower numbers could produce catastrophic failures, it&#8217;s
not really feasible to create super negative rolls; a failure is a
failure. You could use a fumble table, but I don&#8217;t.</p>

<h3 id="negativemodifiers">Negative Modifiers</h3>

<p>Just subtract the modifier from the 3d6 roll. Don&#8217;t roll the bonus die.</p>

<h3 id="advantageanddisadvantage">Advantage and Disadvantage</h3>

<p>Just re-roll the entire roll.</p>

<h2 id="playtest">Playtest</h2>

<p>We&#8217;ve used this system for a few weeks, and it seems to work well. Most
of our players enjoy it. Some don&#8217;t like it as much. Those who haven&#8217;t
enjoyed it use the standard dice rule; we haven&#8217;t noticed a particular
disparity in success for one system or the other. The DM is using it and
likes it. He just jots the bonus dice down next to the monster/NPC
attacks.</p>

<h2 id="morepolyhedralfunnexttime">More Polyhedral Fun Next Time</h2>

<p>There is more that can be done, but my word count <s>is fast
approaching</s> has surpassed my self-imposed limit, so I will wait for
my next article to address more thoughts on this subject. As a hint,
think Warhammer FRP 3e.</p>

<p>What do you think? In particular, I would appreciate a more rigorous
analysis; if it&#8217;s busted I would like to know about it. Contact me via
e-mail or Twitter (@icosahedron)</p>
