<p><em>This is a long recount, so I&#8217;ve broken it up by days. Today is the lead
up to GenCon.</em></p>

<p>My son and I attended GenCon 2013 this year. Since he is soon leaving
the nest and has long wanted to attend, I decided that this would be a
good send off for him.</p>

<h2 id="registrationandhotelreservation">Registration and Hotel Reservation</h2>

<p>GenCon has long held registration on the web. It was easy and painless
to sign up for our badges.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t want to wait until the hotels became available since I knew
they would be booked quickly. Instead I booked a room outside the hotel
reservation system. La Quinta is only a 15 minute walk from the Indiana
Convention Center (ICC) and had reasonable rates for the time.</p>

<p>Event registration was smooth, though not without anxiety. Rather than
try and handle everyone&#8217;s registrations at the same time and crash the
system, they implemented a queue; when you completed and submitted your
wish list, you would wait to receive the results.</p>

<p>Tanis and I decided early on to try and get into the D&amp;D Next All Access
(DDNAA) event. We added DDNAA to our wish list along with several others
events, including backups if we didn&#8217;t get into the DDNAA. Thankfully we
did get into the DDNAA and just about every other event we registered
for. (We ended up returning quite a few tickets at the show.)</p>

<p>Flights to and from Indianapolis only occur once a day for most
airlines, so to stay the entire convention we opted to stay over Sunday
night and head home Monday.</p>

<h2 id="anticipation">Anticipation</h2>

<p>I knew that Tanis would be excited to go, and I likewise anticipated
GenCon. However, when he mentioned that this had been a dream of his
since age 8, I was a little taken aback. I regret waiting until now to
take him.</p>

<p>With everything set, it was just a waiting game until time to go.</p>

<h2 id="arrival">Arrival</h2>

<p>We left Tuesday night on a redeye and arrived in Indianapolis at 9:30 on
Wednesday morning, via a 4 hour layover in Chicago. We were tired. A
quick shuttle to the hotel and La Quinta was gracious enough to let us
check in early. A quick nap, dinner and then time for our first event.</p>

<h3 id="carcassonne">Carcassonne</h3>

<p>Gamers love to game, and so of course one can find events (in the
registration guide no less) for events on Wednesday night before the
convention.</p>

<p>Tanis and I opted for a 1000 tile Carcassonne game. Such a great way to
start the convention. Laid back and just having fun picking tiles. Tanis
and I came in last place, but that was much more my fault than his. We
didn&#8217;t care.</p>

<p>The game was huge, and we didn&#8217;t come close to using all the tiles, but
it was fun to watch the strategies play out. The eventual winners, the
Red team, won through resources and <s>lucky</s> prescient farm
placement.</p>

<p>The event was a great success. Many thanks to the gentlemen who
organized it (I wish I remembered their names).</p>

<h2 id="andonwards">And Onwards</h2>

<p>We went back to our hotel and collapsed in exhaustion. Set the alarm for
early, because tomorrow we begin the Greatest Four Days In Gaming!</p>
