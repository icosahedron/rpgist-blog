<p><em>This is the unedited sample that I wrote during the seminar. See my
<a href="./gencon_2013_sunday.html">GenCon 2013 Sunday</a> write-up for more
information.</em></p>

<p>There is a time in everyone’s life when everything changes. For Maxwell,
that was when he moved into a quiet, suburban neighborhood.</p>

<p>Nothing seemed quite so final in his life as seeing the moving van drive
off. The final clang of the door, the pleasantries and well wishes
exchanged between his mother and the men; it was… definitive.</p>

<p>Considering that he had moved 5 times in the previous 7 years, he did’t
expect that he would feel this way. But there it was, sharp.</p>

<p>He turned to enter the door. His mother stood there, in the doorway, a
knowing smile on her face. She would give him the “stiff upper lip” and
“soon you’ll have lots of friends again” quotes he had grown accustomed
to. Such as it was, his entire life had been this way.</p>

<p>She shut the door as Maxwell slouched into his bean bag, his only
possession currently not in a box. His mother’s voice continued on, the
reassurance of all the sights they could see and how their landlady had
mentioned the white liger at the zoo and…</p>

<p>“Mom, do you think they will ever stop?”</p>

<p>She stopped mid sentence, brow furrowing and her thumb going into the
tall-tale nail biting that signaled her anxiety over what to say next.</p>

<p>“I, I don’t know. Your father had hoped it wouldn’t have even started
yet, but he was, well, he was wrong about that. And so many other
things.” she trailed off.</p>

<p>Here it came. Maxwell should have known better. His mother was still too
fragile; he should have waited until they were settled and the trauma of
the last incident wasn’t so fresh.</p>

<p>She put on her ‘let’s change the topic’ smile.</p>

<p>“Hey, let’s order a pizza and watch a movie.”</p>
